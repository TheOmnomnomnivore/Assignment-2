            <h2>The tables have turned</h2>
            <p>Dinosaurs are known for dominating the mesozozic era, with mammals only coming to power after the K-T extinction.
                However, in July, a new fossil was discovered in China that shows that mammals were not always the prey.
                The fossil was of a Repenomamus robustus, a mammal that lived during the Cretaceous period. It was found
                with the remains of a Psittacosaurus, a small herbivorous dinosaur that was only 6 feet long.
                The mammals was must smaller, only 16 inches long, yet the fossil depicts it biting the dinosaur's
                ribs and grasping it with its claws. Somehow, these two died midcombat.</p>
            <p>The mammals may have been small and rat-like, but the discovery of this fossils shows that they cannot
                always just be seen as dinosaur prey, and could possibly take down a dinosaur.</p>
