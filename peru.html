            <h2>The heaviest animal to ever exist?</h2>
            <p>In August, there was news about the discovery of the preserved skeleton of an extinct whale.
                This was located in the Paracas Formation in Peru. This genus was named Perucetus, and it is estimated
                to have been 17-20 meters long, and weighed from 84-335 tons. This makes it possibly the heaviest animal
                that has even existed on Earth.</p>
            <p>What makes the Perucetus so heavy? Well, it's not only because of its sheer size, but also because it 
                evolved an extreme degree of pachyosteosclerosis, which is the thickening and densification of bones. 
                This is common in aquatic vertebrates and even more so for ones that reside in shallow water. The 
                large bones make the animal more buoyant.</p>
            <p>It is thought to have been slow moving, swimming like a manatee, and feeding on benthic organisms
                via suction or filter feeding.</p>
