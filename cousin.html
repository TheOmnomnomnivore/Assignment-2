            <h2>5 new fossils found in Morroco</h2>
            <p>In August, some new fossils were discovered that were shown to have been a primitive cousin of
                the infamous Tyrannosaurus Rex. The dinosaur itself is currently unnamed but it is actually in
                the family Abelisauridae, instead of the Tyrannosauridae family. Abelisaurids are known of their
                short snouts and arms even smaller than T.rex.</p>
            <p>The fossils were discovered in Morocco, but it was not the only species found there recently,
                4 other species where recovered in the same spot. A hadrosaur (duck-billed) named Ajnabia, a
            titanosaur (long-necked), and two other abelisaurs, one of them is called Chenanisaurus, and is quite large.</p>
